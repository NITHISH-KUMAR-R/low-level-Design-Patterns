Observer Design Pattern: The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.
When one object (the subject) changes its state, it notifies all dependent objects (observers) so that they can update themselves accordingly.
This way, the observers(subscribers) get the recent updates and can take appropriate actions based on the new information.

Observer Pattern:
The subject (publisher) maintains a list of observers (subscribers) and notifies them directly of any changes.
The observers are aware of the subject they are observing.
WhatsApp displaying update statuses, the application itself acts as the subject (publisher), while the users are the observers (subscribers).
Here's how it aligns with the Observer pattern:

WhatsApp (Subject): The application that changes its state by posting update statuses.
Users (Observers): People using WhatsApp who get notified of these updates and can view the status changes.

When WhatsApp updates its status, it pushes this information to all users (observers).
Users then receive the notification and update their app to see the new status.
This automatic update and notification system reflects the Observer pattern,
 where the subject keeps all observers informed about any state changes.
